/**
 * Establish TCP connection with retry mechanism and exponential backoff
 * 
 * This function attempts to connect to the mesh network via TCP.
 * If the connection fails (error -14 ERR_CONN or other errors), it will
 * retry up to TCP_CONNECT_MAX_RETRIES times before triggering a full
 * WiFi reconnection cycle.
 * 
 * The retry mechanism helps handle timing issues where:
 * - The TCP server may not be immediately ready after AP initialization
 * - Network stack may need time to stabilize after IP acquisition
 * - Transient network conditions may cause temporary connection failures
 * - Multiple nodes connecting simultaneously may cause temporary overload
 * 
 * Exponential backoff is used to increase delay between retries, which:
 * - Gives the TCP server more time to recover from overload
 * - Reduces network contention when multiple nodes are retrying
 * - Improves overall connection success rate in congested networks
 * 
 * @param client AsyncClient to use for connection
 * @param ip Target IP address
 * @param port Target port
 * @param mesh Reference to mesh instance for callbacks
 * @param retryCount Current retry attempt (default 0, used internally for recursion)
